# Final CIT Portfolio :sunglasses:
[Hello-World repo](https://github.com/JustinMiller333/hello-world)

This website is my project portfolio that I have created while taking a CIS 281 course at the University of Oregon. I have added three projects thus far to this page with links to all of the project pages. These projects are all made using GitHub and involve the use of APIs.
## Project Two :open_hands:
[First GitHub project page](https://uo-cit.github.io/p2-17S-JustinMiller333/)

## Project Three :raised_hands:
[Get images using flickr and 500px](https://uo-cit.github.io/p3-17s-JustinMiller333/)

## Project Four :clap:
